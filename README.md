   - # Python program to print "Hello, World!"
 print("Hello, World!")

This simple Python program demonstrates key syntax elements such as comments, the print() function, string literals, and indentation.
Python's readability and straightforward syntax make it ideal for beginners and professionals alike, enabling quick and effective development of various applications.

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
   - 
Basic Data Types in Python:
Integer (int):

Whole numbers without decimals.
Example: age = 25
Float (float):

Numbers with decimals.
Example: pi = 3.14
String (str):

Sequence of characters enclosed in quotes.
Example: name = "Alice"
Boolean (bool):

Represents truth values True or False.
Example: is_active = True
List (list):

Ordered collection of items.
Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3]
Tuple (tuple):

Immutable ordered collection of items.
Example: coordinates = (3, 5)
Dictionary (dict):

Collection of key-value pairs.
Example: person = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30}
Example script:age = 25
pi = 3.14
name = "Alice"
is_active = True
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
coordinates = (3, 5)
person = {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 30}

print("Age:", age)
print("Pi:", pi)
print("Name:", name)
print("Is Active:", is_active)
print("Numbers:", numbers)
print("Coordinates:", coordinates)
print("Person:", person)

Explanation:
Each variable (age, pi, name, is_active, numbers, coordinates, person) demonstrates a different data type.
Variables store values like numbers, text, lists, and dictionaries, enabling Python to handle diverse types of data efficiently.
Printing variables with print() shows their stored values, illustrating how Python manages and displays different data types.

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
   - 
Control Structures in Python:
Conditional Statements (if-else):
Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on whether a condition is True or False.

Example of an if-else statement:# Example of an if-else statement
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are not yet an adult.")
    
Explanation:

In this example, age is assigned the value 20.
The if statement checks if age is greater than or equal to 18.
If the condition (age >= 18) is True, it executes the block of code under if (prints "You are an adult.").
If the condition is False, it executes the block under else (prints "You are not yet an adult.").
Loops ( for loop):
Loops in Python are used to repeatedly execute a block of code until a condition is met or for a fixed number of times.

Example of a for loop:


# Example of a for loop
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

for num in numbers:
    print(num)
Explanation:

numbers is a list containing integers [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
The for loop iterates over each element (num) in the numbers list.
During each iteration, the current value of num is printed using the print() function.
Summary:
Conditional Statements (if-else): Used to make decisions based on conditions (if evaluates a condition and executes code if true, else executes code if false).
Loops (for loop): Used to iterate over a sequence (like a list or string) and execute code for each item in the sequence.
These control structures are fundamental in programming as they enable developers to control the flow of execution and iterate over data, making Python versatile for handling various tasks from simple decision-making to complex data processing.

6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.
   - Functions in Python:
Functions in Python are reusable blocks of code designed to perform a specific task. They help in organizing and structuring code, making it more readable and maintainable. Functions can take inputs (arguments), perform operations, and return outputs (results).

Why Functions Are Useful:

Code Reusability: Write once, use multiple times.
Modularity: Break down complex problems into simpler, manageable pieces.
Readability: Makes code easier to understand and maintain.
Testing: Isolating code into functions makes it easier to test individual parts.
Example Function:
Function to Add Two Numbers:
# Define a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example of calling the function
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("The sum is:", result)
Explanation:
Function Definition (def add_numbers(a, b):):

def keyword is used to define a function.
add_numbers is the name of the function.
(a, b) are parameters that the function accepts.
Return Statement (return a + b):

The function calculates the sum of a and b and returns the result.
Calling the Function (add_numbers(5, 3)):

The function is called with arguments 5 and 3.
The result, 8, is stored in the variable result.
Printing the Result (print("The sum is:", result)):

The output is displayed as "The sum is: 8".
Summary:
Functions: Allow encapsulation of code logic, making programs modular and easier to manage.
Defining Functions: Use the def keyword followed by the function name and parameters.
Calling Functions: Provide the necessary arguments to execute the function and obtain the result.
Functions are essential building blocks in Python, enabling you to write clean, efficient, and organized code.

7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   - Lists and Dictionaries in Python:
Lists:

Ordered collections of items.
Access by index.
Example:
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(numbers[0])  # Output: 1
Dictionaries:

Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
Access by unique keys.
Example:
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
print(person["name"])  # Output: Alice
Example Script:
# List operations
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.append(6)            # Add 6 to the list
print(numbers)               # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
print(numbers[1])            # Output: 2 (second item)

# Dictionary operations
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}
person["city"] = "New York"  # Add a new key-value pair
print(person)                # Output: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
print(person["name"])        # Output: Alice
Summary:
Lists: Use for ordered data, access with index.
Dictionaries: Use for key-value pairs, access with keys.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
   - Exception Handling in Python:
Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur during program execution, allowing the program to continue running or gracefully handle the error. It prevents the program from crashing and provides a mechanism to handle various error conditions.

Key Components:
try block: Contains code that might raise an exception.
except block: Contains code to execute if an exception occurs in the try block.
finally block: Contains code that will run no matter what, whether an exception occurs or not.
Example:
Let's handle a division by zero error using try, except, and finally.

# Example of exception handling
try:
    numerator = 10
    denominator = 0
    result = numerator / denominator
    print("Result:", result)
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: You can't divide by zero.")
finally:
    print("Execution finished.")
Explanation:
try block:

Attempts to execute result = numerator / denominator.
Since denominator is 0, a ZeroDivisionError occurs.
except block:

Catches the ZeroDivisionError and executes the code within it.
Prints "Error: You can't divide by zero.".
finally block:

Executes regardless of whether an exception occurred or not.
Prints "Execution finished.".
Summary:
Exception Handling: Prevents crashes and allows handling of runtime errors.
try block: Code that may cause an error.
except block: Code to handle the error.
finally block: Code that always runs after try and except.
This structure is essential for writing robust programs that can handle unexpected situations gracefully.

9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   - Modules and Packages in Python:
Modules and Packages allow you to organize and reuse code efficiently.

Modules:
Definition: A module is a single file containing Python code.
Usage: You can import and use a module's functions and variables.
Example Using the math Module:

import math  # Importing the math module

# Use the math module to perform operations
print(math.pi)            # Output: 3.141592653589793 (value of Pi)
print(math.sqrt(9))       # Output: 3.0 (square root of 9)
print(math.factorial(5))  # Output: 120 (factorial of 5)
Packages:
Definition: A package is a collection of related modules in a directory.
Usage: Packages help organize modules into a hierarchical structure.
Example of Importing from a Package:

Suppose you have a package named mypackage with a module mymodule.py:

from mypackage import mymodule  # Import mymodule from mypackage

mymodule.my_function()  # Call a function defined in mymodule
Summary:
Modules: Single files you can import using import.
Packages: Directories containing multiple modules for better organization.
These concepts help manage large codebases and promote code reuse.

Quick Examples:
Using the math Module:

import math

# Calculate the area of a circle with radius 3
radius = 3
area = math.pi * radius ** 2
print(area)  # Output: 28.274333882308138

# Find the cosine of 45 degrees
cosine_45 = math.cos(math.radians(45))
print(cosine_45)  # Output: 0.7071067811865476
Creating and Using a Simple Module:

Create a file mymodule.py:


# mymodule.py
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"
Import and use it in another script:

import mymodule

print(mymodule.greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
These examples show how to use built-in modules and create your own modules for organized code.

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
    - File I/O in Python
File I/O allows you to read from and write to files in Python.

Reading from a File:
Use the open function to read a file's content.

Example: Reading a File

# Read and print the content of a file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
'example.txt': Name of the file to read.
'r': Read mode.
Writing to a File:
Use the open function to write a list of strings to a file.

Example: Writing to a File

# List of strings to write
lines = ["Hello, World!", "Python is awesome!"]

# Write each string to a new line in the file
with open('output.txt', 'w') as file:
    for line in lines:
        file.write(line + '\n')
'output.txt': Name of the file to write.
'w': Write mode (creates or overwrites the file).
Summary:
Read: Use open(filename, 'r') and file.read().
Write: Use open(filename, 'w') and file.write(data).
These examples demonstrate basic file reading and writing in Python.
